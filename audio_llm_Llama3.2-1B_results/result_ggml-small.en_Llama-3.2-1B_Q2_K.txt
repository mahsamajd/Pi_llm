   against the Song dynasty to the south. Kublai besieged Xiangyang between 1268 and 1273,
   the last obstacle in his way to capture the rich Yangtze River basin.
   An unsuccessful naval expedition was undertaken against Japan in 1274.
   Kublai captured the Song capital of Hangzhou in 1276. The wealthiest city of China,
   Song loyalists escaped from the capital and enthroned a young child as Emperor Bing of
   Song. The Mongols defeated the loyalists at the Battle of Yaman in 1279.
   The last Song emperor drowned. Bringing an end to the Song dynasty,
   the conquest of the Song reunited northern and southern China for the first time in 300
   years. Question. Where did Kublai build his administration's strength?
Response: The Song capital of Hangzhou in 960 AD.

   preparatory schools or prep schools, boarding schools and day schools. Tuition at private
   secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors.
   Including the location of the school, the willingness of parents to pay,
   peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment, high tuition, schools claim,
   is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning.

Transcription: Context, terra preta, black earth, which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest,
   is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management.
   The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously
   hostile environment, meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result
   of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been
   supposed. In the region of the Shinggu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in
   the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues
   of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas,

Transcription: Context. Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues.
   They are divided into four classes. Type 1. IV. Based on the mechanisms involved
   in the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity is an immediate or
   anaphylactic reaction. Often associated with allergy, symptoms can range from mild discomfort
   to death. Type 1 hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of masked
   cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type 2 hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies
   bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called
   antibody-dependent or cytotoxic hypersensitivity and is mediated by IgE and IgM antibodies. Immune
   complexes, aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgE and IgM antibodies deposited in
   various tissues trigger type 3 hypersensitivity reactions. Type 4 hypersensitivity, also known
   as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity, usually takes between two and three days to
   develop. Type 4 reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases,
   but may also involve contact dermatitis, poison ivy. These reactions are mediated by T cells,
