   This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer.
   Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.
   Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication.
   Since squaring can be reduced to multiplication, question.
   According to polynomial time reduction squaring can ultimately be logically reduced to what?

Transcription: Context, Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Alston, a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge.
   With the intent of major expansion southward, the university now owns approximately 50% more land in Alston than in Cambridge.
   Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Alston campus include new and enlarged.
   Bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram.
   Plans also call for sinking part of Starrow Drive, at Harvard's expense, for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River.
   As well as the construction of bike paths, and buildings throughout the Alston campus,
   the institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school,
   but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure.
   Possible shuttles open to the public.
   And park space which will also be publicly accessible, question.
   How much more land does the school own in Alston than Cambridge?

   In equality, he points out that nations with high rates of unionization.

Transcription: context, the most basic method of checking the "promality" of a given integer n is called
   "trial division". This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater
   than 1 and less than or equal. To the square root of n, if the result of any of these divisions
   is an integer, then n is not a prime. Otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if it's composite,
   with an nb is not equal 1, then one of the factors are b is necessarily at most. For example,
   4, the trial divisions are by m equals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, none of these numbers divides 37.
   So 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of
   primes up to is known. Then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.
   For example, to check the "promality" of 37, only three divisions are necessary.
   m equals 2, 3, and 5, given that 4 and 6 are composite, question. What must the integer m be less
   less than or equal to when performing trial division.
