Transcription: context, the most basic method of checking the "promality" of a given integer n is called
   "trial division". This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater
   than 1 and less than or equal. To the square root of n, if the result of any of these divisions
   is an integer, then n is not a prime. Otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if it's composite,
   with an nb is not equal 1, then one of the factors are b is necessarily at most. For example,
   4, the trial divisions are by m equals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, none of these numbers divides 37.
   So 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of
   primes up to is known. Then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.
   For example, to check the "promality" of 37, only three divisions are necessary.
   m equals 2, 3, and 5, given that 4 and 6 are composite, question. What must the integer m be less
   less than or equal to when performing trial division.

   Conical measures, and caduciuses in their logos.
   Other symbols are common in different countries.
   The Green Greek Cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India,
   the increasingly rare gaper in the Netherlands, and a red stylized letter A in Germany and Austria.

Data: {'id': '572a0bf96aef051400155204', 'title': 'Immune_system', 'context': "Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I – IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy).

Transcription: Context, hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues.
   They are divided into four classes.
   Type 1, IV.
   Based on the mechanisms involved in the time course of the hypersensitive reaction.
   Type 1 hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction.
   Often associated with allergy, symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death.
   Type 1 hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers the granulation of mast cells and
   basophils when cross-linked by antigen.
   Type 2 hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells.
   Marking them for destruction, this is also called antibody dependent.
   Or cytotoxic, hypersensitivity, and is mediated by egg and IgM antibodies.
   Immune complexes, aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgM antibodies.
   Deposited in various tissues trigger Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions.
   Type 4 hypersensitivity, also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity.
   Usually takes between 2 and 3 days to develop.
   Type 4 reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases.
   But may also involve contact dermatitis.
