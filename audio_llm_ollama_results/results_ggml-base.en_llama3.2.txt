Transcription: Context. Fresno is the largest U.S. city not directly linked to an interstate highway.
   When the interstate highway system was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build
   what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley. And thus bypass many of the
   population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99,
   due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along State Route 99.
   As well as the desirability of federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to
   interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as
   Interstate 9. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance,
   and other concerns are currently underway, question. Which State Route has been in discussion
   to upgrade to interstate standards?

   Some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.
   Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the inconvenience of visiting a doctor
   or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe.
   However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who

Transcription: context. The most basic method of checking the
   primality of a given integer n is called trial division.
   This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1
   and less than or equal. To the square root of n,
   if the result of any of these divisions is an integer,
   then n is not a prime. Otherwise it is a prime.
   Indeed, if is composite, with nb does not equal 1. Then one of the factors are b
   is necessarily at most. For example, 4, the trial divisions are
   by m equals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers
   divides 37. So 37 is prime. This routine can be
   implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known.
   Then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.
   For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary.
   m equals 2, 3, and 5, given that 4 and 6 are composite,
   question. What must the integer m be less than or equal to when performing trial
   division?

Transcription: Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties.
   Especially among large firms in the past, architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an architecture
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from.
   All related fields as employees or to have an associated company that provides each

   interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors
   were more likely to be what.
