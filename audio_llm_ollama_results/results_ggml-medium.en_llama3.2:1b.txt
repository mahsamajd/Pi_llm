   Gaulish name Rhinos, which was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Greek Rhinos,
   Rhinos, Latin Rhinos. Note 3. The spelling with Rh in English Rhine as well as in German Rhine
   and French Rhine is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the vocalization I is due to
   the proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as *Rhinos via Old Frankish giving Old English Rhine,

   Rhine, also adopted in Romansh Rhine). Rhine is a central German development of the early modern

   Mongke Khan commenced a military campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China.
   The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the
   Middle East in 1256. He died in 1259 without a successor.
   Kublai returned from fighting the Song in 1260 when he learned that his brother,

   Kublai convened a keraltai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan.
   A rival keraltai in Mongolia proclaimed Arik Boke Great Khan.
   Beginning a civil war, Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to
   ensure that his army received ample resources. He bolstered his popularity among his subjects
   by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting

Transcription: Context. The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial
   division. This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less
   than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer,
   then n is not a prime. Otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if as composite, with a and b does not
   equal 1, then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most. For example, for the trial
   divisions are by m equals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37. So 37 is prime.
   This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known.
   Then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example,
   to check the primality of 37, only 3 divisions are necessary. m equals 2, 3, and 5, given that
   4 and 6 are composite. Question. What must the integer m be less than or equal to when performing
   Trial Division.

   course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic
   reaction. Often associated with allergy, symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death.
   Type 1 hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils
   when cross-linked by antigen. Type 2 hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to
   antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody
   dependent or cytotoxic hypersensitivity and is mediated by IgE and IgM antibodies. Immune
   complexes, aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgE and IgM antibodies deposited
   in various tissues trigger type 3 hypersensitivity reactions. Type 4 hypersensitivity also known as
   cell mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity usually takes between 2 and 3 days to develop.
   Type 4 reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases but may also involve
   contact dermatitis, poison ivy. These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.
   Question. What is the name for a response of the immune system that damages the body's native
   tissues.

Transcription: Context. A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time.
   High supply. Competing for a job that few require. Low demand. Will result in a low wage for that job.
   This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs
   such as dish washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive
   down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job.
   A job where there are few able or willing workers. Low supply. But a large need for the positions.
   High demand. Will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between
   employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require
   highly developed skills. Rare abilities. Or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers
   tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job. Since there is a relative shortage of
   workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of
   workers which results in higher demand. And greater incomes for members. Members may also
   receive higher wages through collective bargaining. Political influence. Or corruption. Question.
   Why does competition among workers drive down wages?

Transcription: Context. Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and
   mechanisms of the innate immune system. The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are
   identified by pattern recognition. Receptors, which recognize components that are conserved
   among broad groups of microorganisms, or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out
   alarm signals. Many of which, but not all, are recognized by the same receptors as those that
   recognize pathogens. Innate immune defenses are non-specific, meaning these systems respond to
   pathogens in a generic way. This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen.
   The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms' question.
   The innate immune system responds in a generic way. Meaning it is what?
