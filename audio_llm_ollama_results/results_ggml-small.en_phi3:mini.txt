   conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims
   should not only always oppose infidels in every way but hate them for their religion.
   For all is sake, that democracy is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century.
   That Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc. While this effort has by no
   means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam,
   it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi
   interpretation of Islam as the "gold standard" of religion in minds of some.
   Or many Muslims question, what type of interpretation of Islam does Salafism promote?

Transcription: Context Some theories developed in the 1970s
   established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic
   development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality,
   were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has
   risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly
   stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing
   yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years
   for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association
   between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic
   growth. Developing countries with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high rates
   for a few years, but longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the
   income. Distribution, question, what are longer growth spells associated with?

Transcription: Context Another important role of the immune system
   is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance.
   The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells.
   To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign,
   and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
   The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources. Some are derived from oncogenic viruses
   like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own
   proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.

   This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time.
   For example, the problem of squaring an integer
   can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers.
   This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer.
   Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.
   Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication,
   since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

Transcription: Context. Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Alston, a walk across the Charles River from
   Cambridge. With the intent of major expansion southward, the university now owns approximately
   50% more land in Alston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with
   the new Alston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram.
   Plans also call for sinking part of Staro Drive, at Harvard's expense, for replacement with park
   land and pedestrian access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths and
   buildings throughout the Alston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will
   benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the
   enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space
   which will also be publicly accessible, question, how much more land does the school own in Alston
   than Cambridge?

   Tenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations.
   But in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find.
   In bays where they occur in very high numbers,
   predation by tenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as
   copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton.
   Planktonic plants, which are a vital part of marine food chains,
   one tenophore, nemeopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea,
   where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larva and organisms.
   That would otherwise have fed the fish.
   The situation was aggravated by other factors,
   such as overfishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the nemeopsis.

   The later accidental introduction of Barrow helped to mitigate the problem.
   As Barrow prays on other tenophores,
   question what tenophore was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea.

Transcription: Context. On the other hand, in the late 1980s the western Atlantic Tinafore Nemeopsis Lidi was
   accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships,
   and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larva and small

   territories, although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea,

   Nemeopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental
   introduction of the Nemeopsis eating North American Tinafore Barrow ovata, and by a cooling

Transcription: Context
   The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th-17th
   centuries. However, the original Greek roots from pharmacos imply sorcery or even poison.
   In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice
   and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners
   such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma, as it was referred to, often operated through a retail
   shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines.
   Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as
   the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy. In English the term
   apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only appropriate if herbal remedies were on offer to
   a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word pharmacia, Greek
   pharmacia, derives from pharmacin, pharmacin, meaning "drug," "medicine," or "poison," N1.

Transcription: Context. Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues.
   They are divided into four classes. Type 1. IV. Based on the mechanisms involved
   in the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity is an immediate or
   anaphylactic reaction. Often associated with allergy, symptoms can range from mild discomfort
   to death. Type 1 hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of masked
   cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type 2 hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies
   bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called
   antibody-dependent or cytotoxic hypersensitivity and is mediated by IgE and IgM antibodies. Immune
   complexes, aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgE and IgM antibodies deposited in

Transcription: Context. A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time.
   High supply. Competing for a job that few require. Low demand. Will result in a low wage for that
   job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would
   be jobs such as dish washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down
   wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in. Relation to his or her particular job. A job
   where there are few able or willing workers. Low supply, but a large need for the positions.
   High demand. Will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers
   for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly
   developed skills. Rare abilities. Or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to
   drive up wages due to the nature of the job. Since there is a relative shortage of workers
   for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of
   workers which results in higher demand. And greater incomes for members. Members may also
   receive higher wages through collective bargaining. Political influence or corruption. Question. Why
   does competition among workers drive down wages.
