Transcription: Context. In 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years.
   And there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought.
   A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research
   Centre results. Showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of
   drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the
   article that this. Drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate,
   are pushing the rainforest towards a tipping point where it would irreversibly start to die.
   It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savannah or desert.
   With catastrophic consequences for the world's climate, question. What organisation
   predicted that the Amazon forest could survive only three years of drought?

Transcription: Context The most basic method of checking the
   primality of a given integer n is called trial division.
   This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal
   to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer,
   then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if its composite with a n-b is not equal
   1, then one of the factors rb is necessarily at most. For example, for the trial divisions
   are by m equals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime.
   This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known.
   Then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example,
   to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary. m equals 2, 3, and 5, given that
   4 and 6 are composite, question, what must the integer m be less than or equal to when performing
   trial division.

   to death. Type 1 hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of masked
   cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type 2 hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies
   bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called
   antibody-dependent or cytotoxic hypersensitivity and is mediated by IgE and IgM antibodies. Immune
   complexes, aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgE and IgM antibodies deposited in
   various tissues trigger type 3 hypersensitivity reactions. Type 4 hypersensitivity, also known
   as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity, usually takes between two and three days to
   develop. Type 4 reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases,
   but may also involve contact dermatitis, poison ivy. These reactions are mediated by T cells,
   monocytes, and macrophages. Question. What is the name for a response of the immune system
   that damages the body's native tissues.

Transcription: Context. A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time.
   High supply. Competing for a job that few require. Low demand. Will result in a low wage for that
   job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would
   be jobs such as dish washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down
   wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in. Relation to his or her particular job. A job
   where there are few able or willing workers. Low supply, but a large need for the positions.
   High demand. Will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers
   for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly
   developed skills. Rare abilities. Or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to
   drive up wages due to the nature of the job. Since there is a relative shortage of workers
   for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of
   workers which results in higher demand. And greater incomes for members. Members may also
   receive higher wages through collective bargaining. Political influence or corruption. Question. Why
   does competition among workers drive down wages.

Transcription: Context. Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and
   mechanisms of the innate immune system. The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are
   identified by pattern recognition. Receptors. Which recognize components that are conserved
   among broad groups of microorganisms. Or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out
   alarm signals. Many of which, but not all, are recognized by the same receptors as those that
   recognize pathogens. Anate immune defenses are non-specific. Meaning these systems respond to
   pathogens in a generic way. This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen.
   The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms question.
   The innate immune system responds in a generic way. Meaning it is what?
