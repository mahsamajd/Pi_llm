According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development.

Transcription: Context. Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which
   inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review,
   savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced
   consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income
   inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had
   a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality
   figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to
   manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between
   lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth.
   Developing countries with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high
   rates for a few years, but longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in
   the income. Distribution. Question. What are longer growth spells associated with?

   antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign,
   and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
   The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources. Some are derived from oncogenic viruses
   like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own
   proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.
   One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain
   skin cells, e.g. melanocytes, into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source
   of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival that
   commonly mutate into cancer-inducing molecules called oncogenes. Question. What is the process
   by which the immune system identifies tumors called.

   This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time.
   For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying
   two integers.
   This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer.
   Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.

Transcription: Context. Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Alston, a walk across the Charles River from
   Cambridge, with the intent of major expansion southward. The university now owns approximately
   50% more land in Alston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with
   the new Alston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram. Plans
   also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive at Harvard's expense for replacement with park land
   and pedestrian access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths and
   buildings throughout the Alston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will
   benefit not only the school but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the
   enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public and park space which will also
   be publicly accessible. Question. How much more land does the school own in Alston than Cambridge?

   of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income
   gap than technological changes in globalization, which were also experienced by other industrialized
   nations that didn't experience steep surges in inequality. He points out that nations with high

   Mongke Khan commenced a military campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China.
   The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the
   Middle East in 1256. He died in 1259 without a successor.
   Kublai returned from fighting the Song in 1260 when he learned that his brother,
   Arik Boke, was challenging his claim to the throne.
   Kublai convened a keraltai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan.
   A rival keraltai in Mongolia proclaimed Arik Boke Great Khan.
   Beginning a civil war, Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to
   ensure that his army received ample resources. He bolstered his popularity among his subjects
   by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting
   the Chinese-era name of Zhongtong. Arik Boke was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered

Transcription: Context. On the other hand, in the late 1980s the western Atlantic ctenophore Nemeopsis
   lydae was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships
   and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larva and small
   crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Nemeopsis is well equipped to invade new
   territories although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea
   as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.
   The impact was increased by chronic overfishing and by eutrophication that gave the entire
   ecosystem a short-term boost causing the Nemeopsis population to increase even faster than normal
   and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores.
   Nemeopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental
   introduction of the Nemeopsis eating North American ctenophore Barrow ovata and by a cooling of the
   local climate from 1991 to 1993 which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the
   abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Nemeopsis levels. Question
   what is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea in the Sea of Azov?

Transcription: Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties,
   especially among large firms in the past. Architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an "architecture"
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees,
   or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may
   offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction project. From beginning to end,
   this is designated as a "design-build" contract where the contractor is given a performance
   specification and must undertake the project from design to construction.
   While adhering to the performance specifications, question, even in large firms, architects,
   interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers,
   and general contractors were more likely to be what?

   court. Where it was sometimes labeled as Wei Wei or Muslim medicine, the Nestorian physician Jesus
   the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Hubele.
   Wei Wei doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family

   No Chinese translation of western medical works is known, but it is possible that the Chinese had
   access to Avicenna's the canon of medicine. Question. Who founded the Office of Western
   medicine.

Transcription: Context. When a T cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor.
   This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T cell to bind to the active form of vitamin
   D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D.
   Not only does the T cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the
   steroid hormone version of vitamin D calcitriol, but the T cell expresses the gene 27 billion
   Cypriot pounds one, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin
   D calcidiol into the steroid hormone version calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol
   can T cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express

   keratinocytes and macrophages. Question. What does a T cell extend when it encounters a foreign pathogen?

Transcription: Context. In 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire, from a European ship,
   prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste.
   Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that such highly toxic waste should never have left
   the European Union, with countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic
   waste. Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to
   create criminal sentences for ecological crimes. The competence for the Union to do this was
   contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission.
   That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal
   law, something never done before. So far, the only other proposal has been the draft Intellectual
   Property Rights Directive. Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation
   on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but was rejected at vote. However,
   in October 2007, the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal
   sanctions could be, only that there must be some question. In which year did a toxic waste spill
   from a European ship prompt the Commission to look into legislation against waste?
