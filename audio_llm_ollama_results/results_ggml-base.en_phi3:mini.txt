Transcription: context. Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.
   This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not
   found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence
   causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors
   have several sources. Some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus,
   which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels
   in normal cells but reach. High levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase
   that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells, e.g. melanocytes, into tumors
   called melanomas, a third possible source of tumor antigens or proteins normally important for
   regulating cell. Growth and survival that commonly mutate into cancer-inducing molecules called oncogenes
   question. What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?

Transcription: Context. Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Alston, a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge,
   with the intent of major expansion southward. The university now owns approximately 50 percent
   more land in Alston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new
   Alston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and or a tram. Plans also call
   for sinking part of Starrow Drive, at Harvard's expense, for replacement with park land and pedestrian
   access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths and buildings throughout
   the Alston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school,
   but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure.
   Possible shuttles open to the public. And park space which will also be publicly accessible,
   question. How much more land does the school own in Alston than Cambridge?

Transcription: context, although lacking historical connections to the Middle East.
   Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71 percent of its imported oil came from
   the Middle East in 1970. On November 7, 1993, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared
   Japan a "nonfriendly" country to encourage it to change. Its non-involvement policy,
   it received a 5 percent production cut in December. Causing a panic, on November 22,
   Japan issued a statement asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories.
   Advocating Palestinian self-determination and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel
   if Israel refused to accept these. Pre-conditions. By December 25, Japan was considered an Arab-friendly
   state, question. When did Japan release a statement to tell Israelis to withdraw from the Palestine?

   n often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.
   For instance, the language xx x as any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape
   Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines.
   If we allow polynomial variations in running time,
   Kaba Medman's thesis states that the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models.
   Of computation are polynomially related. Goldreich 2008, chapter 1.2, this forms the basis for
   the complexity class p, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine
   within polynomial. Time, the corresponding set of function problems is fp, question.
   A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution.

Transcription: context, through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of
   electric charge. A rule of vector multiplication called Lorentz's law describes the force on
   a charge moving in a magnetic field. The connection between electricity and magnetism
   allows for the description of a unified. Electromagnetic force that acts on a charge.
   This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force. Due to the electric field
   and the magnetic force, due to the magnetic field, fully stated, this is the law. Question,
   what are the electrostatic and magnetic force they written as the sum of?

Transcription: Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties.
   Especially among large firms in the past, architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an architecture
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from.
   All related fields as employees or to have an associated company that provides each
   necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may offer itself as one-stop shopping for a construction
   project. From beginning to end, this is designated as a "design build" contract where the contractor
   is given a performance. Specification and must undertake the project from design to construction.
   While adhering to the performance specifications, question, even in large firms, architects,
   interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors
   were more likely to be what.
