   Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the inconvenience of visiting a doctor
   or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe.
   However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous.
   Especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk-benefit
   ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication.
   There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.
   Question.
   What practice do some internet pharmacies engage in?
Response: Internet pharmacies that sell prescription drugs without a valid prescription.

Explanation:

The transcription is:

For context, while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid
 prescription, some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.

   relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions
   than hydrophobic amino acids. However, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques
   using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins. As a training set,
   a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloging of epitopes from pathogens known
   to be recognizable by B-cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity

Transcription: Context. A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time.
   High supply. Competing for a job that few require. Low demand. Will result in a low wage for that job.
   This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs
   such as dish washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive
   down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job.
   A job where there are few able or willing workers. Low supply. But a large need for the positions.
   High demand. Will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between
   employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require
   highly developed skills. Rare abilities. Or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers
   tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job. Since there is a relative shortage of
   workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of
   workers which results in higher demand. And greater incomes for members. Members may also
   receive higher wages through collective bargaining. Political influence. Or corruption. Question.
   Why does competition among workers drive down wages?
Response: Competition between workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of
the worker in relation to his or her particular job. This is because jobs are available in greater
number than there are workers willing to do them. [end of text]
