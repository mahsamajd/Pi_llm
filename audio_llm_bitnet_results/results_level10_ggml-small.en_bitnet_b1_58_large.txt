   The modern trend in design for the integration of previously separated specialties.
   Exactly among large firms in the past, architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies. Even in the larger firms presently, a firm that is nominally an architecture
   or construction management firm may have experts from all related fields of employees or to have

   one-stop shopping for a construction project. From beginning to end, this is designated as a design
