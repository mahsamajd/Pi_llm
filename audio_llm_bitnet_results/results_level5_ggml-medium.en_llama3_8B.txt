   In general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger terms as it is.
   Traditionally, a firm that is nominated in architecture or construction management only have expert funds.
   All related fields are controlled, or to have an associated company that provides each member for their skills.
   Thus, each expert's firm may offer itself a one-stop topic for a construction project.
