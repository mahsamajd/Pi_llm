Transcription:    context, TINA force may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations,
   but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very
   high numbers, predation by TINA force may control the populations of small zooplank tonic organisms
   such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton, planktonic plants,
   which are a vital part of marine food chains. One TINA force, NEMIOPSIS, has accidentally been
   introduced into the black sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating
   both fish larvae and organisms. That would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was
   aggravated by other factors, such as overfishing and long-term environmental changes that
   promoted the growth of the NEMIOPSIS. Population, the later accidental introduction of
   barrow helped to mitigate the problem. As barrow prays on other TINA force, question,
   what TINA for was accidentally introduced into the black sea.
Response: Based on the provided transcription, here is a detailed and specific answer:

The text mentions that there are two types of TINA forces mentioned: TINA force and NEMIOPSIS. To address this information fully, I will provide separate answers for each type.

**TINA Force:**
Unfortunately, the transcription does not explicitly state the name of the first TINA force mentioned (the "context" is only referred to as such). However, it can be inferred that this is likely a specific instance or example related to the situation described. If we were to infer a name based on context, one possibility could be "TINA force" itself, which implies a general category rather than a specific instance.

However, if I had to provide an answer in the format requested and assuming a name was given (e.g., "TINAFORCE"), it would typically involve identifying the specific type of TINA force mentioned. In this case, without further context, I will treat it as an example rather than providing a specific answer.

**NEMIOPSIS:**
The transcription mentions that NEMIOPSIS has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea and is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms. This information directly answers the question about what NEMISSIPOLIS was "accidentally" introduced into the Black Sea.

In conclusion, without a specific name provided in the transcription for the first TINA force mentioned (the "context"), I will focus on addressing the information given regarding NEMISSIPOLIS: it is described as having been accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and causing fish stocks to collapse due to predation by eating other organisms.
