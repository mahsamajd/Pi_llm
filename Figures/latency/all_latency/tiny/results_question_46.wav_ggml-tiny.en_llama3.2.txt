Transcription:    context, the IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund.
   Established in 1989 by the United Nations Environment Program,
   UNF, and the World Meteorological Organization,
   WMO, costs of the Secretary and of housing the Secretariat are provided by the WMO.
   While UNF meets the cost of the DePute Secretary,
   annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO.
   By UNF, and by IPCC members,
   the scale of payments is determined by the IPCC panel,
   which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget.
   The organization is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the WMO,
   Question. Who funds the IPCC's Secretary?
Response: The transcription does not mention who funds the IPCC's Secretary, but rather states that "costs of the Secretary" are provided by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It implies that the WMO covers the expenses related to the Secretary's position.
