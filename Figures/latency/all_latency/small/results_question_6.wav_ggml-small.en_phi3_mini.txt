Transcription:    Context Another important library, the University Library, founded in 1816, is home to over two
   million items. The building was designed by architects Merik Baginski and Zbigniew Badowski
   and opened on the 15th of December 1999. It is surrounded by green. The University Library Garden,
   designed by Irena Bajerska, was opened on the 12th of June 2002. It is one of the largest and
   most beautiful roof gardens in Europe with an area of more than 10,000 m2, 107,639.10 square feet
   and plants covering 5,111 square meters, 55,014.35 square feet. As the University Garden it is open
   to the public every day. Question. How many items is the University Library home to?
Response: The context does not provide specific information about the exact number of two million (2,000,000) or its precise equivalent in square feet that are housed within The University Library. Based on this transcription alone and disregarding any approximations to derive a more accurate count would be speculative without concrete figures given for either metric directly relating to the total number of items stored by the library's collection. Therefore, we can only refer back to it having over two million items in its possession based solely on this transcription text and cannot specify an exact figure beyond that detail provided.
