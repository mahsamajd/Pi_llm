Transcription:    Context Monkey Khan commenced a military
   campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China.
   The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the
   Middle East in 1256. He died in 1259 without a successor.
   Kublai returned from fighting the Song in 1260 when he learned that his brother,
   Arakbok, was challenging his claim to the throne.
   Kublai convened a kuraltai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan.
   A rival kuraltai in Mongolia proclaimed Arakbok Great Khan.
   Beginning a civil war, Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure
   that his army received ample resources. He bolstered his popularity among his subjects
   by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting
   the Chinese-era name of Zhongtong. Arakbok was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered
   in 1264. All of the three western khanates, Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate,
   became functionally autonomous. Although only the Ilkhan's truly recognized Kublai as Great Khan,
   civil strife had permanently divided the Mongol Empire.
