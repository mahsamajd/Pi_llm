   The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th-17th
   centuries. However, the original Greek roots from pharmacos imply sorcery or even poison.
   In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice
   and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners
   such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma, as it was referred to, often operated through a retail
   shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines.
   Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as
   the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy. In English the term
   apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only appropriate if herbal remedies were on offer to
   a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word pharmacia, Greek
   pharmacia, derives from pharmacin, pharmacin, meaning "drug," "medicine," or "poison," N1.
   How would the word apothecary be viewed by contemporary English speakers?
