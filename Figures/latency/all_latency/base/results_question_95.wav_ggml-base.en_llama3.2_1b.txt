Response: Based on the provided transcription, it appears that the Brotherhood renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals in the 1970s. This is mentioned explicitly in the answer key.

However, to provide a detailed and specific response:

The statement "By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals" implies that this change occurred before QTB's execution in 1996. 

Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine exactly when the Brotherhood renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals, but the transcription suggests that this was an earlier event.

In fact, Hassan al-Hudaybi remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism until his death in 1996, indicating that the Brotherhood's shift towards radicalism occurred prior to QTB's execution.
