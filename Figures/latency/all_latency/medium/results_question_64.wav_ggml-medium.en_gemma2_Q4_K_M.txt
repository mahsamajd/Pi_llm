Transcription:    Context. On the other hand, in the late 1980s the western Atlantic ctenophore Nemeopsis
   lydae was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships
   and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larva and small
   crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Nemeopsis is well equipped to invade new
   territories although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea
   as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.
   The impact was increased by chronic overfishing and by eutrophication that gave the entire
   ecosystem a short-term boost causing the Nemeopsis population to increase even faster than normal
   and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores.
   Nemeopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental
   introduction of the Nemeopsis eating North American ctenophore Barrow ovata and by a cooling of the
   local climate from 1991 to 1993 which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the
   abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Nemeopsis levels. Question
   what is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea in the Sea of Azov?

Answer:

The most likely answer is that the ctenophore, Nemeopsis, has caused the sharp drop in fish catches because they are eating the fish.
There is a link between the ctenophore and fish catches because Nemeopsis is a
