Transcription:    Context. Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract
   secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the beta defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase
   A2 in saliva. Tears. And breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a
   chemical barrier following monarchy. When they become slightly acidic. While semen contains
   defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as
   powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens. Question. What compounds in the
   stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Answer: The stomach protects against pathogens by a number of means. One, in the stomach, the
   gastric juice contains digestive enzymes that break down ingested food. Second, the stomach
   secretion produces hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid that
