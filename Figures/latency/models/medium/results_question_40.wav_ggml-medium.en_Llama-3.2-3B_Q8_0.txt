Transcription:    Context. In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in
   oil prices and being challenged by underdeveloped countries that they briefly considered military
   action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973, although no explicit plan was
   mentioned. A conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador
   to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that it was no longer
   obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force. British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried
   by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions,
   which concluded America might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its
   allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries and that they would prefer
   a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in
   military action was decided upon, although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not
   involve force. Intelligence warned the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the
   West developed alternative energy sources and would result in the total alienation of the Arabs
   and much of the rest of the third world question. Which country was worried that the U.S. would
   invade the Middle East?
