   Year 12 is known as lower 6 and year 13, upper 6. This category includes university preparatory
   schools or prep schools, boarding schools and day schools. Tuition at private secondary schools
   varies from school to school and depends on many factors, including the location of the school,
   the willingness of parents to pay, peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment. High tuition,
   schools claim, is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide

   services such as libraries, science laboratories and computers. Some private schools are boarding
   schools and many military academies are privately owned or operated as well.
