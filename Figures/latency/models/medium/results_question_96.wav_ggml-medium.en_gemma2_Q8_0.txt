Transcription:    Context. Each sitting day, normally at 5 p.m., MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that
   have been moved that day. This decision time is heralded by the sounding of the division bell,
   which is heard throughout the parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to
   return and vote. At decision time, the presiding officer puts questions on the motions and
   amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking,
   "Are we all agreed?" To which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent,
   the presiding officer announces there will be a division and members vote by means of electronic
   consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which,
   when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote.
   As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.
