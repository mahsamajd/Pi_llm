Transcription:    Context. From here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name Rieen no longer
   coincides with the main flow of water. Two-thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows
   farther west, through the Wall and then, via the Merweed and New Merweed, De Beesbosch,
   merging with the Meuse, through the Hollands Deep and Herringveld estuaries, into the North Sea,
   the Beneden-Merweed branches off, near Hardincksveld geessenden and continues as the Nord,
   to join the Lech, near the village of Kinderdijk, to form the New Maas, then flows past Rotterdam
   and continues via Hetscher and the New Water Weg. To the North Sea, the Oud Maas branches off,
   near Dordrecht, farther down rejoining the New Maas to form Hetscher,
   Question. Which direction does two-thirds of the Rhine flow outside of Germany?
