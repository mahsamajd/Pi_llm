Transcription:    Context. Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen.
   DC electricity must be used. If AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2 to 1.
   Contrary to popular belief, the 2 to 1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical
   formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves.
   A similar method is the electrocatalytic O2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well,
   such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life support equipment on submarines and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies.
   Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current
   to produce nearly pure O2 gas. Question. Electrolysis of what can be used to produce oxygen and hydrogen.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: Electrolysis of water can be used to produce oxygen and hydrogen. The process involves the use of direct current (DC) electricity. If alternating current (AC) is used, the gases in each limb consist
