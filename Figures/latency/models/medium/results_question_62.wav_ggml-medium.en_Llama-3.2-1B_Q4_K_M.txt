Transcription:    Context. By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward
   Warsaw, knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland. The Polish government
   in exile in London gave orders to the Underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw
   from the Germans before the Red Army arrived. Thus, on the 1st August 1944, as the Red Army
   was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began, the armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours,
   was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days. Eventually the Home Army
   fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate. They were transported
   to POW camps in Germany. While the entire civilian population was expelled, Polish
   civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000. Question. How many days did the Warsaw Uprising last?
