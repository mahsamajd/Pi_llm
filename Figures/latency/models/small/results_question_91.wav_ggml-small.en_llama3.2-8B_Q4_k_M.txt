Transcription:    Context. From here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name Rhian no longer
   coincides with the main flow of water. Two-thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther
   west, through the Wall and then, via the Merweed and New Merweed, de Biesbosch, merging with the
   Meuse, through the Hollands Deep and Herringvleet estuaries. Into the North Sea, the Benedyn Merweed
   branches off, near Hardinksvild Giesendam and continues as the Nord, to join the Lech, near the
   village of Kinderdijk, to form the New Moss, then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het-Schurr
   and the New Water Weg. To the North Sea, the Oud-Moss branches off, near Dordrecht, farther down
   rejoining the New Moss to form Het-Schurr, question. Which direction does two-thirds of the Rhine flow
   outside of Germany.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
