Transcription:    Context. The executive summary of the WGI summary for policymakers report says they are certain that
   emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric
   concentrations of the greenhouse gases resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth's
   surface. They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced
   greenhouse effect. They predict that under a business as usual bow scenario, global mean
   temperature will increase by about 0.3 degrees Celsius per decade during the 21st century.
   They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 degrees Celsius over
   the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the
   same magnitude as natural climate variability. The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse
   effect is not likely for a decade or more. Question. How much of the greenhouse effect
   is due to carbon dioxide?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
