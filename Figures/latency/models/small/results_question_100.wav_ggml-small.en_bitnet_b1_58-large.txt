Transcription:    Context. Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and
   mechanisms of the innate immune system. The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are
   identified by pattern recognition. Receptors. Which recognize components that are conserved
   among broad groups of microorganisms. Or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out
   alarm signals. Many of which, but not all, are recognized by the same receptors as those that
   recognize pathogens. Anate immune defenses are non-specific. Meaning these systems respond to
   pathogens in a generic way. This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen.
   The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms question.
   The innate immune system responds in a generic way. Meaning it is what?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:    The innate immune system is a collection of cells and molecules that recognize the
   presence of microbes. The innate immune system is found in the tissue and organs of all
   animals and plants. The cells
