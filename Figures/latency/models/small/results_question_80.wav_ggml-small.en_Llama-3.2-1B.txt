Transcription:    Context, terra preta, black earth, which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest,
   is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management.
   The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously
   hostile environment, meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result
   of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been
   supposed. In the region of the Shinggu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in
   the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues
   of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas,
   Question. Who discovered this and where did they come from?
