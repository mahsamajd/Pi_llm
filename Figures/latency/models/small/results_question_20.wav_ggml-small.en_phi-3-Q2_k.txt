Transcription:    Context Another important role of the immune system
   is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance.
   The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells.
   To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign,
   and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
   The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources. Some are derived from oncogenic viruses
   like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own
   proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.
   One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain
   skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source
   of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival,
   that commonly mutate into cancer-inducing molecules called oncogenes.
   Question. What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: The organisms are cells that were high levels.
   The cells are biasedh, said out cell-sexy.
   The cells are called elanes.
   The cells are known to be elas, which are biased
