Transcription:    Context. A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time.
   High supply. Competing for a job that few require. Low demand. Will result in a low wage for that
   job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would
   be jobs such as dish washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down
   wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in. Relation to his or her particular job. A job
   where there are few able or willing workers. Low supply, but a large need for the positions.
   High demand. Will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers
   for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly
   developed skills. Rare abilities. Or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to
   drive up wages due to the nature of the job. Since there is a relative shortage of workers
   for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of
   workers which results in higher demand. And greater incomes for members. Members may also
   receive higher wages through collective bargaining. Political influence or corruption. Question. Why
   does competition among workers drive down wages.

   does competition among workers drive down wages.
Answer:

Competition between workers will drive wages down. This is because workers are often
relatively expendable. They are easily replaced. So if wages go up, workers will likely
find other work. In other words, workers tend to be relatively competitive.
