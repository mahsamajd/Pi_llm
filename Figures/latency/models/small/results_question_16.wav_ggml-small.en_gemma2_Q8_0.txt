Transcription:    Context Some theories developed in the 1970s
   established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic
   development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality,
   were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has
   risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly
   stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing
   yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years
   for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association
   between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic
   growth. Developing countries with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high rates
   for a few years, but longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the
   income. Distribution, question, what are longer growth spells associated with?
