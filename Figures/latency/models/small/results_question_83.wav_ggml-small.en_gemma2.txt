Transcription:    Context. The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to
   are generated by life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and the carotenes,
   contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, carbohydrates contain the
   largest proportion by mass of oxygen. All fats, fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins contain
   oxygen, due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues.
   Oxygen also occurs in phosphate (PO3-4) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying
   molecules ATP and ADP, in the backbone and the purines, except adenine, and pyramidines of RNA
   and DNA, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite. Question. Which organic compounds
   contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass?
Answer:    The greatest amount of oxygen by mass is found in the amino acids, the sugars, the
   proteins, the fats, the fatty acids, and the nucleic acids. This is because these biomolecules contain
   the greatest number of carbons by
