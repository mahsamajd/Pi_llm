Transcription:    Context Following the Cretaceous Palaeogene
   extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the
   tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66 to 34 Maya, the rainforest
   extended as far south as 45 degrees. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years
   have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the oligocene, for example,
   the rainforests spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the middle Miocene,
   then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforests
   still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution
   of a broad diversity of species, question. During which period in history was the Amazon
   rainforest a narrow band of forest?

Answer: 
   During the Miocene, the tropical rainforest was a narrow band of forest that spanned 45 degrees south of the equator. The Amazon rainforest was a narrow band of forest that spanned approximately 10 degrees south of the equ
