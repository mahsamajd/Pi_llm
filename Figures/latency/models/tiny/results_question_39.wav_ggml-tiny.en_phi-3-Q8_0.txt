Transcription:    context, but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function F. N, often yields
   complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language
   XXx as any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing. Machine,
   but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines.
   If we allow polynomial variations in running time, cob-em-ed-men's thesis states that
   the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models.

   the complexity class P. Which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic
   Turing machine within polynomial. Time, the corresponding set of function problems
   is FP, question. A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution.
