Transcription:    context, TINA force may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations,
   but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very
   high numbers, predation by TINA force may control the populations of small zooplank tonic organisms
   such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton, planktonic plants,
   which are a vital part of marine food chains. One TINA force, NEMIOPSIS, has accidentally been
   introduced into the black sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating
   both fish larvae and organisms. That would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was
   aggravated by other factors, such as overfishing and long-term environmental changes that
   promoted the growth of the NEMIOPSIS. Population, the later accidental introduction of
   barrow helped to mitigate the problem. As barrow prays on other TINA force, question,
   what TINA for was accidentally introduced into the black sea.
