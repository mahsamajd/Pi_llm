Transcription:    context, terraprata, black earth, which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest,
   is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this
   fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment,
   meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of
   human. Management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region
   of the Shingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest
   were found in 2003 by Michael Hackenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida.
   Among those were evidence of roads. Bridges and large plazas, question. Who discovered this
   What was this and where did they come from?

Answer:  In 2003, Michael Hackenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida discovered these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon rainforest by using a combination of satellite data, remote sensing and archaeological analysis. These settlements were located in the middle
