Transcription:    Context, other components are often present, pumps, such as an injector, to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensors to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporization.
   And superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapor point.
   And various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel.
   From a supply bin, bunker, to the firebox, see, mechanical stoker question, what components raise steam temperature above its saturated vapor point.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: A superheater is a device used to heat the steam produced by a boiler, and is typically used in the steam power station.
   In the case of a steam power station, the steam produced by a boiler is used to produce electrical energy.
