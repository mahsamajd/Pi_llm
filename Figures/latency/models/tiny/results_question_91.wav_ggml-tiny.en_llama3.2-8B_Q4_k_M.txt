Transcription:    context. From here, the situation becomes more complicated. As the Dutch name re-in no longer
   coincides with the main flow of water. Two-thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine
   flows farther west. Through the wall and then, via the moorweed and new moorweed,
   Debis Bosch, merging with the muse, through the Holland's deep and herring fleet estuaries.
   Into the north sea, the beneden-moorweed branches off. Near hardings filled geysundum and
   continues as the nord. To join the lek, near the village of Kinderdeek. To form the new moss,
   then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Hetcher in the new water wag.
   To the north sea, the ud moss branches off. Near Dordricked, farther down rejoining the new moss
   to form Hetcher, question. Which direction does two-thirds of the Rhine flow outside of Germany?
