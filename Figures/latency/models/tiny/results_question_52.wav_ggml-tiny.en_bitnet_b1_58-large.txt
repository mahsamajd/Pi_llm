Transcription:    context, the property of being prime, or not, is called primality, a simple but slow method of
   verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing
   whether n is a multiple of any integer between two n. Algorithms much more efficient than trial
   division have been devised to test the primality of large. Numbers, these include the Miller
   Raven primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS
   primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to
   be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as
   Merced numbers, as of January 2016. Update, the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits,
   question. What is the name of one algorithm useful for conveniently testing the
   the normality of large numbers.

Answer:    AKS algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm that is fast and efficient in the
   case of large numbers. AKS algorithm is very useful for testing the normality of large
   numbers. AKS algorithm is used by the Mathematics
