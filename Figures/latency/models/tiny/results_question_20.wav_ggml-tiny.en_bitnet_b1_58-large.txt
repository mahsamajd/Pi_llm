Transcription:    Context, another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.
   This is called immune surveillance.
   The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells.
   To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
   The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources.
   Some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus.
   Which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach.
   High levels in tumor cells.
   One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that.
   When expressed at high levels.
   Transforms certain skin cells, e.g. melanocytes, into tumors called melanomas, a third possible source of tumor antigens or proteins normally important for regulating cell.
   Growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer-inducing molecules called oncogenes, question.
   What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?

Answer:    The immune system identifies tumors by the presence of antigens on tumors, and tumors themselves may express antigens or proteins that are not found on normal cells.
