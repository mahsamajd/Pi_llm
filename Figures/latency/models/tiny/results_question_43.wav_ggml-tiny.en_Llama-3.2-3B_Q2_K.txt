Transcription:    Context, other components are often present, pumps, such as an injector, to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensors to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporization.
   And superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapor point.
   And various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel.
   From a supply bin, bunker, to the firebox, see, mechanical stoker question, what components raise steam temperature above its saturated vapor point.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: I am a bit confused by the last sentence. It talks about the coal, but then there is a bit of confusion. I do not know what they mean. They mention the coal, but the chain or screw stoking mechanism. It does not
