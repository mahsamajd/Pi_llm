Transcription:    context, the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important too.
   Are generated by life, only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and
   the carotenes, contain no oxygen, of the organic compounds with biological relevance.
   Carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen, all fats, fatty acids,
   amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen, due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these
   acids and their ester residues. Oxygen also occurs in phosphate, PO3-4, groups in the
   biologically important energy carrying molecules ATP and ADP. In the backbone and the purines,
   except adenine, and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA. An in-bones is calcium phosphate and
   hydroxylapatite, question. Which organic compounds contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: Carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen among the organic compounds with biological relevance. This is because carbohydrates contain carbonyl groups and their ester residues, which
