Transcription:    context, the property of being prime, or not, is called primality, a simple but slow method of
   verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing
   whether n is a multiple of any integer between two n. Algorithms much more efficient than trial
   division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. These include the Miller-Rabin
   primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test,
   which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.
   Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Merced numbers.
   As of January 2016. Update, the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits,
   question. What is the name of one algorithm useful for conveniently testing the primality of large numbers?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
