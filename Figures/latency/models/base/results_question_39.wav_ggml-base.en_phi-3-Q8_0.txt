   n often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.
   For instance, the language xx x as any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape
   Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines.

   within polynomial. Time, the corresponding set of function problems is fp, question.
   A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution.

   A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution.
Answer: A multi-tape Turing machine can solve the language xx x in linear time. This is because a multi-tape Turing machine allows for multiple actions to occur in parallel, thereby reducing the overall computation time compared to a single-ta
