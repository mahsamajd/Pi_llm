Transcription:    Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties.
   Especially among large firms in the past, architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an architecture
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from.
   All related fields as employees or to have an associated company that provides each
   necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may offer itself as one-stop shopping for a construction
   project. From beginning to end, this is designated as a "design build" contract where the contractor
   is given a performance. Specification and must undertake the project from design to construction.
   While adhering to the performance specifications, question. The modern trend in design is toward
   integration of what?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
