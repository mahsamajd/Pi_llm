Transcription:    Context. Following the Cretaceous-Paliogen extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the
   wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.
   From 66 to 34 Maya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45 degrees.
   Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into.
   The tropics. During the oligocene. For example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.
   It expanded again during the middle Miocene. Then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the
   last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods.
   Allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species. Question.
   During which period in history was the Amazon rainforest a narrow band of forest.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:
The Amazon rainforest was a narrow band of forest during the Oligocene period, which occurred approximately 34 to 23 million years ago. During this time, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band and expanded
