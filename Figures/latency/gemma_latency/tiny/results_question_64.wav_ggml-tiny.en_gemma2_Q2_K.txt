Transcription:    context. On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic Tina-4 NEMIOPSIS
   LIDI was accidentally introduced. Into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships.
   And has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larva and small.
   Cristations that would otherwise feed the adult fish, NEMIOPSIS is well equipped to invade new
   territories. Although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea.
   As it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.
   The impact was increased by chronic overfishing. And by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem
   a short-term boost. Causing the NEMIOPSIS population to increase even faster than normal,
   and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced Tina-4s.
   NEMIOPSIS populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental.
   Introduction of the NEMIOPSIS eating North American Tina-4 baro ovata.
   And by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993.
   Which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism? However the abundance of plankton in the area
   seems unlikely to be restored to pre NEMIOPSIS.
   Levels, question, what is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov?
