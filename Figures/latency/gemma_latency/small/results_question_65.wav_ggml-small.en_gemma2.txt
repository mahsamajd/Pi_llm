Transcription:    Context. Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete
   antimicrobial peptides such as the beta-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in
   saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier
   following menarche when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc
   to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses
   against ingested pathogens. Question. What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
