Transcription:    Context. Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract
   secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the beta defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase
   A2 in saliva. Tears. And breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a
   chemical barrier following monarchy. When they become slightly acidic. While semen contains
   defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as
   powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens. Question. What compounds in the
   stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:
Gastric acid. Gastric acid and pepsin protect against ingested pathogens by destroying microbes and
enzymes that attack cells. [end of text]
