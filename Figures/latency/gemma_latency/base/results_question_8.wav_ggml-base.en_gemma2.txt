Transcription:    context, the early Cambrian sessile frond like fossil stromatoverus.
   From China's Changjong Lagerstadt and dated to about 515 million years ago,
   is very similar to Vendo Bayanta of the preceding Ediacaran period.
   Dagon Shue, Simon Conway Morris et al. found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia.
   Used for filter feeding, they suggested that stromatoverus was an evolutionary ant of tena force.
   And that tena force originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and
   changed. The cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system, question. Stromatoverus is
   similar to which genus.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
