Transcription:    Context, following the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event.
   The extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to.
   Spread out across the continent. From 66 to 34 Maya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45
   degrees. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed Savannah regions to
   expand into. The tropics, during the oligosene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively
   narrow band. It expanded again during the middle myosene, then retracted to a mostly inland
   formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these
   glacial periods. Allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species,
   question. During which period in history was the Amazon rainforest a narrow band of forest.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
