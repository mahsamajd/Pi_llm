Transcription:    Context, other components are often present, pumps, such as an injector, to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensors to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporization.
   And superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapor point.
   And various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel.
   From a supply bin, bunker, to the firebox, see, mechanical stoker question, what components raise steam temperature above its saturated vapor point.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:   The superheater is a device that heats steam above its saturation temperature.
   For example, a steam turbine that operates at a high pressure and temperature and therefore requires a superheated steam.
   A superheater consists of a series of
