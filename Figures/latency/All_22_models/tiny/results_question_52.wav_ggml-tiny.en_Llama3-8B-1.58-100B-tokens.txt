Transcription:    context, the property of being prime, or not, is called primality, a simple but slow method of
   verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing
   whether n is a multiple of any integer between two n. Algorithms much more efficient than trial
   division have been devised to test the primality of large. Numbers, these include the Miller
   Raven primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS
   primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to
   be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as
   Merced numbers, as of January 2016. Update, the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits,
   question. What is the name of one algorithm useful for conveniently testing the
   the normality of large numbers.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: The AKS primality test is a good test for numbers that are not composite, but it is too slow for numbers that are huge, so you should use a different algorithm for testing the primality of those numbers. One way to do this is
