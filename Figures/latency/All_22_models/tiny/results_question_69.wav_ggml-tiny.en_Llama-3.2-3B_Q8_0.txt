   Emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases.
   Resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface, they calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse.

Answer: The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon, which occurs because of the presence of certain gases in the atmosphere. These gases absorb infrared radiation from Earth's surface and radiate this energy back to the Earth's surface. This process of absorbing and radiating energy
