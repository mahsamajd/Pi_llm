Transcription:    Context, the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important too.
   Are generated by life, only a few common complex biomolecules,
   such as squalene and the carotines.
   Contain no oxygen, of the organic compounds with biological relevance.
   Carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen.
   All fats, fatty acids, amino acids,
   and proteins contain oxygen, due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues.
   Oxygen also occurs in phosphate, PO3-4, groups in the biologically important energy carrying molecules ATP and ADP.
   In the backbone and the purines, except adenine, and pyramidines of RNA and DNA,
   and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite, question.
   Which organic compounds contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   Which organic compounds contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass?
Answer: Carbohydrates contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass among organic compounds. This is because they are structured around carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, with the formula Cx(H2O)y
