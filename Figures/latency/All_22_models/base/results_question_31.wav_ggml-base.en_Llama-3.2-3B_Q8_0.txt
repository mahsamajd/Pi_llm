Transcription:    Context. Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Alston, a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge,
   with the intent of major expansion southward. The university now owns approximately 50 percent
   more land in Alston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new
   Alston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and or a tram. Plans also call
   for sinking part of Starrow Drive, at Harvard's expense, for replacement with park land and pedestrian
   access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths and buildings throughout
   the Alston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school,
   but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure.
   Possible shuttles open to the public. And park space which will also be publicly accessible,
   question. How much more land does the school own in Alston than Cambridge?
