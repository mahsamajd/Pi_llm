Transcription:    context, larger drugs, greater than 500 daltons, can provoke a neutralizing immune response,
   particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the
   effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins, which are typically larger than 6,000
   daltons. In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an
   immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for taxol. Computational methods have
   been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly
   useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral
   coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques
   relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented.
   In epitope regions then hydrophobic amino acids. However, more recent developments rely on
   machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied
   virus proteins. As a training set, a publicly accessible database has been established for
   the cataloging of epitopes from pathogens. Known to be recognizable by B cells,
   the emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as
   immunoinformatics. Immuno proteomics is the study of large sets of proteins.

Answer:

Immunoinformatics, a field that integrates bioinformatics with immunology, is the study of the
interactions between the immune system and drugs or other foreign substances in the body. This
field is used to study the immunogenicity of drugs that are
