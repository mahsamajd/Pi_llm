   through the Hollins deep and herringvlete estuaries. Into the North Sea, the Benadine Merweed branches

   of Kinderdeek. To form the New Moss. Then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Shure and
   the New Waterweg. To the North Sea, the Eud Moss branches off. Near Dordrecht, farther down rejoining
   the New Moss to form Het Shure, question. Which direction does two-thirds of the Rhine flow outside
   of Germany?
