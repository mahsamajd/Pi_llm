Transcription:    context, but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f.
   n often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.
   For instance, the language xx x as any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape
   Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines.
   If we allow polynomial variations in running time,
   Kaba Medman's thesis states that the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models.
   Of computation are polynomially related. Goldreich 2008, chapter 1.2, this forms the basis for
   the complexity class p, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine
   within polynomial. Time, the corresponding set of function problems is fp, question.
   A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution.
