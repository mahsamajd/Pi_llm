   Alston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and or a tram. Plans also call
   for sinking part of Starrow Drive, at Harvard's expense, for replacement with park land and pedestrian
   access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths and buildings throughout
   the Alston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school,
