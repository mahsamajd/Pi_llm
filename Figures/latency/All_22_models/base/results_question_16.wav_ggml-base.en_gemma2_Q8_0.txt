Transcription:    context. Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which
   inequality may have. A positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review,
   savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced
   consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income
   inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a
   positive. Effect on economic development. Analysis based on comparing yearly equality figures to
   yearly growth rates were misleading because. It takes several years for effects to manifest as
   changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of
   inequality in developing. Countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries
   with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years but longer
   growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income. Distribution. Question.
   What are longer growth spells associated with?

   What are longer growth spells associated with?
Answer:

Inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient, which is the area under the Lorenz curve (the line
that represents the cumulative proportion of the distribution of income among the population). A
higher Gini coefficient means greater inequality. The coefficient can
