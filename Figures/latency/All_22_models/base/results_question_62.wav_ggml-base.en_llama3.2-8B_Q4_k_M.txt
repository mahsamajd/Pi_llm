Transcription:    Context. By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans
   toward Warsaw. Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland.
   The Polish government in exile in London gave orders to the underground home army.
   A.K. to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived.
   Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city,
   the Warsaw uprising began. The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours,
   was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days. Eventually the home army fighters and
   civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate. They were transported to POW camps in Germany,
   while the entire civilian population was expelled. Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between
   150,000 and 200,000, question. How many days did the Warsaw uprising last?
