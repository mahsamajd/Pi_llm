Transcription:    context. Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.
   This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not
   found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence
   causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors
   have several sources. Some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus,
   which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels
   in normal cells but reach. High levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase
   that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells, e.g. melanocytes, into tumors
   called melanomas, a third possible source of tumor antigens or proteins normally important for
   regulating cell. Growth and survival that commonly mutate into cancer-inducing molecules called oncogenes
   question. What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer: The process by which the immune system identifies tumors is called immune surveillance. During immune surveillance, the immune system recognizes and eliminates tumors by identifying specific antigens expressed by tumor cells
