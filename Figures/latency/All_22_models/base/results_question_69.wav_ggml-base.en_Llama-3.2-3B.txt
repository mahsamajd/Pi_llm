Transcription:    Context. The executive summary of the WGI summary for policymakers report says they are certain that
   Emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric
   concentrations of the greenhouse gases
   Resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth's surface
   They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse
   Effect they predict that under a business as usual
   Bao scenario global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 degrees celsius per decade during the
   21st century they judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 degrees celsius over the last
   100 years broadly consistent with prediction of climate models but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability
   The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or
   more question how much of the greenhouse effect is due to carbon dioxide
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   more question how much of the greenhouse effect is due to carbon dioxide
Answer:    Based on the information provided, we can see that the executive summary of the WGI summary for policymakers report states that they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, resulting in an additional warming of the
