Transcription:    Context. Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which
   inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review,
   savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced
   consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income
   inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had
   a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality
   figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to
   manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between
   lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth.
   Developing countries with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high
   rates for a few years, but longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in
   the income. Distribution. Question. What are longer growth spells associated with?
