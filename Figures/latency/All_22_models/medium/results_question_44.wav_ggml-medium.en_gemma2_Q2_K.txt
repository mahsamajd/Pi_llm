Transcription:    Context. Larger drugs greater than 500 Daltons can provoke a neutralizing immune response,
   particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly or in larger doses. This limits
   the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins, which are typically
   larger than 6,000 Daltons. In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic but may be co-administered
   with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for taxol. Computational methods have
   been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides in proteins, which are particularly
   useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in
   viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques
   relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions
   than hydrophobic amino acids. However, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques
   using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins. As a training set,
   a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloging of epitopes from pathogens known
   to be recognizable by B-cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity
   is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins.
   Proteomics. Involved in the immune response. Question. What is the field of studying immunogenicity
   through bioinformatics known as?

Answer: The immune system consists of a network of cells, which include antibodies, hormones,
   and cells, which have been engineered to target specific proteins for the immune system,
   and also immune-related cells, which are found in the immune system
