Transcription:    Context. Terra Preta, Black Earth, which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest,
   is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile
   soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment, meaning that
   large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human
   management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed in the region of the
   Xingu tribe. Remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest
   were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida.
   Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas. Question. Who discovered this and
   and where did they come from?
