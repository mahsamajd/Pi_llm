Transcription:    context, but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f n often yields
   complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language xx x
   as any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily
   requires quadratic time in the model of single tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial
   variations in running time, Kaba-Medman's thesis states that the time complexities in
   any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related.
   Goldreich 2008, chapter 1.2, this forms the basis for the complexity class P,
   which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial
   time. The corresponding set of function problems is f p. Question. A multi-tape Turing machine
   requires what type of time for a solution?
