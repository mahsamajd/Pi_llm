   Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months
   in some coastal locations, but in other places
   they are uncommon and difficult to find.
   In bays where they occur in very high numbers,
   predation by ctenophores may control
   the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms
   such as copepods, which might otherwise
   wipe out the phytoplankton.
   Planktonic plants, which are a vital part of marine food
   chains.
   One ctenophore, Nemeopsis, has accidentally
   been introduced into the Black Sea, where
   it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating
   both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise
   have fed the fish.
   The situation was aggravated by other factors,
   such as overfishing and long-term environmental changes
   that promoted the growth of the Nemeopsis population.
   The later accidental introduction of Barrow
   helped to mitigate the problem.
   As Barrow preys on other ctenophores,
   question, what ctenophore was accidentally
   introduced into the Black Sea?

Answer:
Ctenophores are filter-feeding invertebrate marine animals that inhabit the coastal areas. The species of ctenophores vary depending on the geographic location.
Ctenophores are divided into two main groups:
1. Aglantha
2.
