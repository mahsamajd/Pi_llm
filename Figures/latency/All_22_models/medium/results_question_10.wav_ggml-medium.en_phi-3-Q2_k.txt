Transcription:    Context. Following the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs
   and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the
   continent. From 66 to 34 Maya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45 degrees. Climate
   fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into
   the tropics during the oligocene. For example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.
   It expanded again during the middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last
   glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods,
   allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.
   Question. During which period in history was the Amazon rainforest a narrow band of forest?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
