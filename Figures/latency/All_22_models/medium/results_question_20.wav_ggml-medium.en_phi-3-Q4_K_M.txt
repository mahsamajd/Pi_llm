Transcription:    Context. Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.
   This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express
   antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign,
   and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
   The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources. Some are derived from oncogenic viruses
   like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own
   proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.
   One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain
   skin cells, e.g. melanocytes, into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source
   of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival that
   commonly mutate into cancer-inducing molecules called oncogenes. Question. What is the process
   by which the immune system identifies tumors called.

Answer: The process by which the immune system identifies and eliminates tumors is called immune surveill estate. This process relies on the immune system's ability to recognize tumor cells as foreign due to antigens that are not
