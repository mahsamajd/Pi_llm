Transcription:    Context, the property of being prime or not, is called primality.
   A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as
   trial division.
   It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between two and.
   Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality
   of large numbers.
   These include the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability
   of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial
   time but is too slow to be practical.
   Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne
   numbers.
   As of January 2016 update, the largest known prime number has 22338618 decimal digits.
   Question.
   What is the name of one algorithm useful for conveniently testing the primality of large
   numbers?
