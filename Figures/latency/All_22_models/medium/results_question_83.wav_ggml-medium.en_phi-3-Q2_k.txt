Transcription:    Context. The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to,
   are generated by, life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and the carotenes,
   contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance,
   carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen. All fats, fatty acids,
   amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen, due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids
   and their ester residues. Oxygen also occurs in phosphate, PO3-4, groups in the biologically
   important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP. In the backbone and the purines, except adenine,
   and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite,
   question. Which organic compounds contain the greatest amount of oxygen by mass?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
