Transcription:    Context. Other components are often present. Pumps, such as an injector, to supply water to
   the boiler during operation; condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent
   heat of vaporization; and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated
   vapor point; and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used,
   a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel
   from a supply bin/bunker to the firebox.
   C. Mechanical stoker question. What components raise steam temperature above its saturated vapor
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   C. Mechanical stoker question. What components raise steam temperature above its saturated vapor
Answer: There are many different components that contribute to the temperature of steam in a boiler. One of these components is the superheater. The superheater is a device that is used to increase the temperature of the steam after it has been heated in the
