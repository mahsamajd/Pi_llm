Transcription:    Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties,
   especially among large firms in the past. Architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an "architecture"
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees,
   or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may
   offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction project. From beginning to end,
   this is designated as a "design-build" contract where the contractor is given a performance
   specification and must undertake the project from design to construction,
   while adhering to the performance specifications.
   Question. The modern trend in design is toward integration of what?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   Question. The modern trend in design is toward integration of what?
Answer: Integration of the fields of architecture and construction management.

In this context, the following are the concepts you are discussing:

  *   Integrated architecture/design/construction management
  *   Integrated construction management
