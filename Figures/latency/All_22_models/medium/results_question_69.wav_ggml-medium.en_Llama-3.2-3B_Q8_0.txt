Transcription:    Context. The executive summary of the WGI summary for policymakers report says they are certain
   that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric
   concentrations of the greenhouse gases resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth's
   surface. They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced
   greenhouse effect. They predict that under a "business as usual" (BOW) scenario, global mean
   temperature will increase by about 0.3째C per decade during the 21st century. They judge that
   global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6째C over the last 100 years, broadly
   consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate
   variability. The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a
   decade or more. Question. How much of the greenhouse effect is due to carbon dioxide?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:   The greenhouse effect is the warming of the surface of Earth as a result of the absorption of
   infrared radiation (heat) by gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important
   greenhouse gas, accounting for approximately
