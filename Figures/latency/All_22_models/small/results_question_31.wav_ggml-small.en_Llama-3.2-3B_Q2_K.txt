Transcription:    Context. Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Alston, a walk across the Charles River from
   Cambridge. With the intent of major expansion southward, the university now owns approximately
   50% more land in Alston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with
   the new Alston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram.
   Plans also call for sinking part of Staro Drive, at Harvard's expense, for replacement with park
   land and pedestrian access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths and
   buildings throughout the Alston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will
   benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the
   enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space
   which will also be publicly accessible, question, how much more land does the school own in Alston
   than Cambridge?
