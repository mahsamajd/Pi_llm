Transcription:    context, other components are often present, pumps, such as an injector, to supply water
   to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat
   of vaporization, and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated
   vapor point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used,
   a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel.
   From a supply bin, bunker, to the firebox, see, mechanical stoker question,
   what components raise steam temperature above its saturated vapor point?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
