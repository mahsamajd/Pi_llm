   Tenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations.
   But in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find.
   In bays where they occur in very high numbers,
   predation by tenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as
   copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton.
   Planktonic plants, which are a vital part of marine food chains,
   one tenophore, nemeopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea,
   where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larva and organisms.
   That would otherwise have fed the fish.
   The situation was aggravated by other factors,
   such as overfishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the nemeopsis.
   Population
   The later accidental introduction of Barrow helped to mitigate the problem.
   As Barrow prays on other tenophores,
   question what tenophore was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:
   It was the case of a zooplanktonic organism, which is called tenophores, which is a type of zooplankton,
   which has been introduced into the Black Sea, which was a case of accidental introduction,
   which was
