Transcription:    Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties,
   especially among large firms in the past. Architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an "architecture"
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees,
   or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may
   offer itself as one-stop shopping for a construction project. From beginning to end,
   this is designated as a "design build/contract" where the contractor is given a performance.
   Specification and must undertake the project from design to construction.
   While adhering to the performance specifications, question. Even in large firms, architects,
   interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers,
   and general contractors were more likely to be what.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
