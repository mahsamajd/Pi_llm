Transcription:    context, but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields
   complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language xx(x)
   as any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily
   requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations
   in running time, Kaba-Medman's thesis states that the time complexities in any two reasonable

   the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a
   deterministic Turing machine within polynomial. Time. The corresponding set of function problems
   is f(p). Question. A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution.
