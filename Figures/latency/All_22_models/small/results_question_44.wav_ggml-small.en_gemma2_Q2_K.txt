Transcription:    Context. Larger drugs, greater than 500 daltons, can provoke a neutralizing immune response,
   particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits
   the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides in proteins, which are typically larger
   than 6,000 daltons. In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered
   with an immunogenic compound. As is sometimes the case for taxol, computational methods have
   been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides in proteins, which are particularly
   useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral
   coparticles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on
   the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic
   amino acids. However, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases
   of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins. As a training set, a publicly
   accessible database has been established for the cataloging of epitopes from pathogens. Known to be
   recognizable by B cells, the emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity
   is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins.
   Proteomics involved in the immune response question, what is the field of studying
   immunogenicity through bioinformatics known as?

Answer: (500-1000)
   in the case of the vaccine, is a 1000-2000-6000-2000-10000-20
