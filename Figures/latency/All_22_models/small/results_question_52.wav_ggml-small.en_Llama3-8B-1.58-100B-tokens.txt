Transcription:    Context, the property of being prime, or not, is called Pramality, a simple but slow
   method of verifying the Pramality of a given number n is known as Trial Division.
   It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2n.
   Algorithms much more efficient than Trial Division have been devised to test the Pramality of large
   numbers. These include the Miller-Rabon Pramality test, which is fast but has a small probability
   of error, and the AKS Pramality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but
   is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special
   forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of January 2016 update, the largest known prime number has
   22,338,618 decimal digits. Question. What is the name of one algorithm useful
   for conveniently testing the Pramality of large numbers?

Answer:  The Miller-Rabin algorithm is one such algorithm. It is used in RSA, the most widely
   used algorithm for encryption, and is also used in several other algorithms. The algorithm
   is fast but has a small probability of error.
