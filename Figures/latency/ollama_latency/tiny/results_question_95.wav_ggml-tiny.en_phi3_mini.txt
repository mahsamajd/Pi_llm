   Particularly the manifesto milestones, AKA Maum file Tarik, did, however, develop and they pursued a more radical direction.
   By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals, question.
   When had the Brotherhood renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals?
Response: According to the provided transcription, by the mid-1970s, influenced partly by QTB's radical ideas and manifesto milestones such as AKA Maum file Tarik, which developed during his imprisonment prior to execution in 1966. The leadership of the Brotherhood under Hassan al-Hudabe initially remained moderate with an interest in political negotiation and activism despite QTB's increasing radicalization while he was behind bars. However, by the mid-to-late 1970s, as evidenced through this textual evidence, it is clear that they had renounced violence entirely as a means to achieve their goals in pursuit of more peaceful and non-confrontational strategies for political change or advocacy.
