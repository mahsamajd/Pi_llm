Transcription:    context. During 2003–04, the gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by
   17% to $8.7 billion. This represented 24% of national agricultural production total gross value.
   As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometers.
   52,500 square miles. Of Victorian land, this comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface.
   Victorian farms range from small horticultural outfits to large-scale livestock and grain.
   Productions, a quarter of farmland is used to grow consumable crops, question.
   How much did the gross agricultural product increase from 2003–04?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, here is a detailed and specific answer:

The gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17% between 2003-04. To break down this information further, we can calculate the percentage increase in the gross value of agriculture as follows:

Original gross value (2003-04) = $8.7 billion
Increase in gross value (17%) = $8.7 billion x 0.17 = $1.51 billion

So, the gross agricultural product increased by approximately $1.51 billion between 2003-04.

In addition to this increase, we are also informed that:

* The estimated number of farms in Victoria was around 32,463 as of 2004.
* These farms occupied a total area of around 136,000 square kilometers (or approximately 52,500 square miles).
* This represents more than 60% of the state's total land surface.

Therefore, we can conclude that the gross agricultural product increased by both an increase in value and an expansion in the overall farm acreage.
