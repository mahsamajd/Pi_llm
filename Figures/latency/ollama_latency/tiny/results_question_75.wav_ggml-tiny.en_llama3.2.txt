Transcription:    context, from the Eocene onwards, the ongoing alpine orogeny caused ANS rift system to develop
   in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graban. In southwest
   Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the
   southeastern Netherlands. By the time of the Mayocene, a river system had developed in the Upper
   Rhine Graban. That continued northward and is considered the first Rhine River. At that
   time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps. Instead, the watersheds of the Rhone
   and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps, question. What elements from the rift
   system in the alpine orogeny in southwest Germany?
Response: Based on the transcription, the specific elements from the rift system in the alpine orogeny in southwest Germany are:

1. The Upper Rhine Graben.

This region is located in the southern part of the rift system, which developed as a result of the ongoing alpine orogeny in the Eocene period.
