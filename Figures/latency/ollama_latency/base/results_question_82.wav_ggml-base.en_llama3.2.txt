Transcription:    context, philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and
   moving objects. And simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental
   errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the
   sometimes non-obvious force of friction. And a consequently inadequate view of the nature of
   natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion.
   Even at a constant velocity, most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were
   eventually corrected by Galileo. Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton, with his mathematical insight,
   Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved on for nearly 300 years.
   By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted
   the action of forces on objects. With increasing momentum near the speed of light,
   and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia, question.
   Who developed the theory of relativity?
Response: The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein, not Sir Isaac Newton as mentioned in the transcription. Although Galileo and Newton made significant contributions to our understanding of motion and force, it was Einstein who formulated a new and correct theory of relativity that revolutionized our understanding of space and time.

Additionally, while Newton did formulate laws of motion that were fundamental for centuries, his work on gravity was later corrected by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.
