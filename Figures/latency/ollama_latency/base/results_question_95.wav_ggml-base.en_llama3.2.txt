Response: Unfortunately, there is no specific information provided in the transcription to answer the question about when the Brotherhood renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals. The text only mentions that by the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence, but it does not provide a specific date or time frame for this change.

However, according to historical records, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is believed to have officially renounced violence in the 1970s, specifically in 1973. This decision was made during the presidency of Anwar El-Sadat, who was seeking to reduce tensions with the Western powers and modernize Egypt's relationship with the United States.

So, while the transcription does not provide a specific answer, it is possible that the Brotherhood renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals in the 1970s.
