   Question Who funds the IPCC's secretary?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, here is a detailed and specific answer:

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund. The Trust Fund is funded by annual cash contributions made by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This means that the primary source of funding for the IPCC's Secretary comes from the WMO, with a secondary contribution coming from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), also known as UNIP.

In other words, the costs associated with the Secretary and the Secretariat are covered by the World Meteorological Organization. While the United Nations Environment Programme plays a role in meeting the cost of the Deputy Secretary, the majority of funding for the IPCC's leadership positions comes from the WMO through annual contributions to the Trust Fund.
