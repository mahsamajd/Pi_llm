Transcription:    Context. From the Eocene onwards, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused anS rift system to develop
   in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben in southwest Germany and
   eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment in northwest Germany and the southeastern
   Netherlands. By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben
   that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine River. At that time, it did not yet
   carry discharge from the Alps. Instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the
   northern flanks of the Alps. Question. What elements from the rift system in the Alpine
   orogeny in southwest Germany?
Response: The transcription provides information about the development of a rift system in southwest Germany during the Eocene, specifically mentioning two main elements:

1. The Upper Rhine Graben
2. The Lower Rhine Embayment

These are the two main elements from the rift system developed in this zone as a result of the ongoing Alpine orogeny.
