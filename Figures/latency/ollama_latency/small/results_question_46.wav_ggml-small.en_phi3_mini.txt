Transcription:    Context. The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund established in 1989 by
   the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
   Costs of the Secretary and of housing the Secretariat are provided by the WMO.
   While UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary,
   annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP, and by IPCC members.
   The scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel,
   which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget.
   The organization is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the WMO
   Question. Who funds the IPCC's secretary?
Response: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) provides funding for the cost of the Secretary, as stated in the transcription. Additionally, it covers housing costs related to the Secretariat position and contributes annually through cash contributions made by WMO itself as well as UNEP and IPCC members. The scale of these payments is determined collectively by the IPCC Panel based on various considerations such as climate change mitigation projects, assessment reports production costs for developing countries in need assistance to prepare their own national communications/inventories about greenhouse gases emissions sources and sinks, capacity building efforts aimed at strengthening scientific knowledge of atmospheres-ocean interactions through observations. The IPCC Panel ensures that these financial requirements are met while also complying with WMO's established rules for funding allocation towards the organization to maintain fairness in contribution distribution across member states and organizations, including UNEP, WMO itself as well as individual members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This financial system supports IPCCâ€™s mission by ensuring sufficient resources are available for carrying out its crucial work related to climate change mitigation research.
