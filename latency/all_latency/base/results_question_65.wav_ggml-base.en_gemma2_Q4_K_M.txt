Transcription:    Context. Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory
   tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the beta-defensins.
   Enzymes such as lysoszyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva.
   Tears. And breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier
   following menarchy. When they become slightly acidic. While semen contains
   defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases
   serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens. Question.
   What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?

   What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Answer:
The stomach produces hydrochloric acid (HCl) to kill ingested pathogens. The HCl is acidic and
destroys bacteria. It is also corrosive to the stomach lining, which protects the stomach from the
effects of HCl. The mucus in the stomach
