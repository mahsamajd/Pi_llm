Transcription:    context, from the Eocene onwards, the ongoing alpine orogeny caused ANS rift system to develop
   in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the upper Rhine Graban. In southwest Germany
   and eastern France and the lower Rhine Embayment. In northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands.
   By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the upper Rhine Graban,
   that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river. At that time, it did not yet
   carry discharge from the Alps. Instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained
   the northern flanks of the Alps, question. What elements from the rift system in the alpine
   orogeny in southwest Germany?
Response: Based on the transcription, the specific answer to the question is:

The upper Rhine Graben.

This element was mentioned as one of the main components of the ANS (Alpine North-South) rift system that developed during the ongoing alpine orogeny from the Eocene onwards.
