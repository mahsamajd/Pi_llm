Transcription:    Context, the word "pharmacy" is derived from its root word "pharma" which was a term used since the 15th-17th.
   Centuries, however, the original Greek roots from pharmacos imply sorcery or even poison.
   In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by.
   Other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery, the pharma, as it was referred to,
   often operated through a retail shop which. In addition to ingredients for medicines,
   sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary in
   several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern
   pharmacy. In English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only appropriate
   deferble. Remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed.
   The Greek word "pharmachea" Greek, "pharmachea" derives from "pharmican", "pharmican" meaning "drug",
   "medicine", or "poison", "n1", "question", how would the word apothecary be viewed by contemporary English speakers?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, here is a detailed and specific answer to the question:

The term "apothecary" has its roots in ancient Greek, with a complex etymology. The word "pharmacy," which is derived from the root "pharma," can be broken down as follows:

- "Pharma" comes from the Greek word "φarma," which means "sorcery" or "poison."
- However, this usage of "pharma" implies a more sinister connotation, suggesting that it was associated with dark magic and poison.

In contrast, the term "apothecary" originates from the Greek word "ἄποθeca" (apoteca), which is derived from two words:

- "Από-" (apo-) meaning "without"
- "Θέκcers" (thekceers) meaning "keeper" or "storehouse"

So, when combined, "αποθέκcers" essentially means a storehouse of medicines and remedies. This word was later adopted into Latin as "apoteca," and then into Middle English as "apothecary."

In modern English, the term "apothecary" has largely fallen out of favor due to its historical connotations. While it is still used in some contexts to describe a specialized store that sells medicinal products, such as herbal remedies or patent medicines (which are not considered genuine medical treatments), it is generally viewed with skepticism by contemporary English speakers.

In fact, the transcription suggests that the term "apothecary" has been somewhat misused or outdated over time. The use of "a pox on them all" to describe pharmaceutical companies seems to be a historical example of how language and terminology can evolve, but also sometimes perpetuate negative connotations or misunderstandings about certain words or concepts.
