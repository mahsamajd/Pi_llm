Transcription:    Context, philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects.
   And simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force.
   In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction.
   And a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion.
   Even at a constant velocity, most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo.
   Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton, with his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved on for nearly 300 years.
   By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects.
   With increasing momentum near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation in inertia, question, who developed the theory of relativity?
Response: According to the transcription, it was Einstein (Albert Einstein) who developed the theory of relativity. The correct statement is:

"...By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects."
