Transcription:    Context, chemical barriers also protect against infection.
   The skin and respiratory tracts accrete antimicrobial peptides such as the beta defensions.
   Enzymes such as lysizym and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials.
   Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarky.
   When they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensions and zinc to kill pathogens.
   In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens, question.
   What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

Answer:

  Some pathogens may use the digestive system and become a problem.
   Pathogens may use the digestive system and become a problem.
   Pathogens have been used for centuries as a chemical defense against pathogens.
