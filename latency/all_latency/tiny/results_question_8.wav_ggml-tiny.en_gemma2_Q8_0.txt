Transcription:    Context, the early Cambrian sessile-froned like fossil stromatovirus.
   From China's Changjong Logarstat and dated to about 515 million years ago.
   Is very similar to Vendo Bayanta of the preceding Ediacran period.
   De Gond Shoo, Simon Conway Morris et al.
   Found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia.
   Used for filter feeding, they suggested that stromatovirus was an evolutionary
   ant of tina force, and that tina force originated from sessile animals whose
   descendants became swimmers and changed.
   The cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system, question.
   Stromatovirus is similar to which genus.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
