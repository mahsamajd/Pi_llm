Transcription:    Context. The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund established in 1989 by
   the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
   Costs of the Secretary and of housing the Secretariat are provided by the WMO.
   While UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary,
   annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP, and by IPCC members.
   The scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel,
   which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget.
   The organization is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the WMO
   Question. Who funds the IPCC's secretary?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, it appears that the Secretary of the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) is funded through a combination of sources:

1. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): The IPCC receives funding to cover the costs associated with running its Secretariat.
2. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO): The WMO provides financial support for the Secretary's position and the maintenance of the Secretariat.

In other words, the Secretary is not funded by a specific organization or government body alone, but rather by two separate entities: UNEP and WMO.
