Transcription:    Context. On the other hand, in the late 1980s the western Atlantic Tinafore Nemeopsis Lidi was
   accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships,
   and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larva and small
   crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Nemeopsis is well equipped to invade new
   territories, although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea,
   as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.
   The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire
   ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Nemeopsis population to increase even faster than normal,
   and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced Tinafores.
   Nemeopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental
   introduction of the Nemeopsis eating North American Tinafore Barrow ovata, and by a cooling
   of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.
   However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Nemeopsis.
   Levels, question, what is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea and
   the Sea of Azov?

Answer:  The introduction of Nemeopsis Tinafore has caused sharp drops in fish catches, and the introduction
         of North American Tinafore Barrow ovata has helped to reduce the number of Tinafores in the Black Sea.
