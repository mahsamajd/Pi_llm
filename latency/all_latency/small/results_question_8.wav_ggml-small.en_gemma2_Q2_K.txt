Transcription:    Context
   The early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil stromatovirus
   from China's Chengjiang Lagerstadt and dated to about 515 million years ago
   is very similar to Vendobianta of the preceding Ediacaran period.
   Simon Conway Morris et al. found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia
   used for filter feeding.
   They suggested that stromatovirus was an evolutionary "ant" of tenophores
   and that tenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and
   changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system.
   Question
   Stromatovirus is similar to which genus?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   Question
   Stromatovirus is similar to which genus?
Answer:
   Stromatovirus is a related group of bacteria that are found in the same environment
   as the one from which tenocytes came and which was found in the same environment as
   stromatovirus and which was found in the same environment
