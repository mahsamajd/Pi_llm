Transcription:    context. Historically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions
   of static equilibrium where several forces cancelled each other out. Such experiments
   demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities.
   They have magnitude and direction. When two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force,
   the resultant, also called the net force, can be determined by following the parallelogram
   rule of vector addition. The addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram
   gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of
   the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of
   the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However,
   if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also
   be specified in order to account for their effects. On the motion of the body, question,
   What geometric shape is used in equations to determine net force?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, the answer to the question "What geometric shape is used in equations to determine net force?" is:

A parallelogram.

According to the transcription, when two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force (resultant) can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition. This implies that the parallelogram shape plays a crucial role in determining the net force acting on an extended body.
