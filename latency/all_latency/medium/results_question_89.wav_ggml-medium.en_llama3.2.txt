Transcription:    context historically forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions
   of static equilibrium where several forces cancelled each other out such experiments
   demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities they have magnitude
   and direction when two forces act on a point particle the resulting force the resultant
   also called the net force can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition
   the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram gives an equivalent resultant
   vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram the
   magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to
   their sum depending on the angle between their lines of action however if the forces are acting
   on an extended body their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to
   account for their effects on the motion of the body question what geometric shape is used in
   equations to determine net force.
Response: Based on the transcription, the answer to the question about the geometric shape used in equations to determine the net force is:

A parallelogram.

This is stated explicitly in the transcription: "the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram."
