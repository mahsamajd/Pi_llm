Transcription:    Context. The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund. Established in 1989 by the United
   Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), costs of the
   secretariat and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO. While UNEP meets the cost of
   the Deputy Secretary, annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP,
   and by IPCC members. The scale of payments is determined by the IPCC panel, which is also
   responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget. The organization
   is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the WMO. Question. Who funds the IPCC's secretary?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, it can be determined that the IPCC Secretary is funded through a combination of sources:

1. **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)**: The IPCC receives funding from UNEP to cover the cost of its Deputy Secretary.
2. **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**: While the WMO meets the cost of the Deputy Secretary, the organization also provides financial support through annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund.
3. **IPCC Members**: In addition to funding from UNEP and the WMO, the IPCC members themselves contribute annually to the Trust Fund.

The scale of payments for these funds is determined by the IPCC panel, which considers and adopts the annual budget by consensus.
