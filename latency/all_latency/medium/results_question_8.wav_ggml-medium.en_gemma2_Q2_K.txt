Transcription:    Context. The early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil Stromatovirus,
   from China's Chengjiang Lagerstadt and dated to about 515 million years ago,
   is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period.
   Dagon Shu, Simon Conway Morris et al., found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia.
   Used for filter feeding, they suggested that Stromatovirus was an evolutionary ant of ctenophores.
   And that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and
   changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system. Question. Stromatovirus
   is similar to witch genus.
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:
