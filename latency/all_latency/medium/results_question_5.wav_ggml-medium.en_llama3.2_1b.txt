Transcription:    Context, the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift
   within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United
   States foreign policy. In the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott, Arab oil producers
   linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon
   administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to
   pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, U.S. Secretary of
   State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula.
   The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil
   producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.
   Question. On what date did Henry Kissinger negotiate an Israeli troop withdrawal from
   the Sinai Peninsula?
Response: Based on the provided transcription, Henry Kissinger negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula on January 18, 1974.
