Transcription:    context, the IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund.
   Established in 1989 by the United Nations Environment Program,
   UNF, and the World Meteorological Organization,
   WMO, costs of the Secretary and of housing the Secretariat are provided by the WMO.
   While UNF meets the cost of the DePute Secretary,
   annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO.
   By UNF, and by IPCC members,
   the scale of payments is determined by the IPCC panel,
   which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget.
   The organization is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the WMO,
   Question. Who funds the IPCC's Secretary?
Response: Based on the transcription, it appears that the IPCC Trust Fund is funded through contributions from various sources, including:

1. United Nations Environment Program (UNF) - which meets the cost of the Secretary.
2. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) - which provides funding for the Secretary and Secretariat costs.

In addition to these two main contributors, there are no explicit mentions of any external funding sources from other organizations or individuals.
