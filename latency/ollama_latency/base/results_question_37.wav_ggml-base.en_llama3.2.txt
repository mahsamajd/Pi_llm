Transcription:    Context. Tena4s may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations.
   But in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very high
   numbers. Predation by Tena4s may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as
   copods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton. Planktonic plants, which are a vital part of
   marine food chains. One Tena4, nemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea,
   where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms.
   That would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors,
   such as over fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the nemiopsis.
   Population. The later accidental introduction of Baro helped to mitigate the problem.
   As Baro preys on other Tena4s, question. What Tena4 was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea?
Response: The transcription does not provide information about which specific type of Tena4 (Tena4 genus) was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea. It only mentions "nemiopsis" as a specific example of a Tena4 that has been introduced into the Black Sea and blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse.

However, based on external knowledge, nemiopsis is actually a type of zooplanktonic copepod (a small crustacean) belonging to the genus Neomysis or Nemertes, not a member of the Tena4 genus.
