Transcription:    Context. Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary
   and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes
   retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete
   understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction and a consequently inadequate
   view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required
   to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about
   motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo. Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton,
   with his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved
   on for nearly 300 years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity
   that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects, with increasing momenta near the
   speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.
   Question
   Who developed the theory of relativity?
Response: Based on the transcription, here is a detailed and specific answer:

The question asks who developed the theory of relativity. According to the transcription, Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are both credited with developing this theory.

However, it's worth noting that Galileo Galilei made significant contributions to the development of modern physics, including the study of motion and forces, as mentioned in the transcription. While he did not develop a unified theory of relativity like Einstein, his work laid some of the groundwork for later developments.

In particular, Galileo's observations on the motion of objects under different gravitational fields, such as his famous experiment with dropping balls from different heights, challenged the prevailing understanding of gravity and was a precursor to Albert Einstein's development of general relativity.
