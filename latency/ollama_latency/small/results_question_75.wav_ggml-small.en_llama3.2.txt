Transcription:    Context From the Eocene onwards,
   the ongoing alpine orogeny caused ANS rift system to develop in this zone.
   The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben, in southwest Germany and eastern France
   and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands.
   By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben,
   that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine River.
   At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps.
   Instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.
   Question.
   What elements from the rift system in the alpine orogeny in southwest Germany?
Response: The answer to the question is that the Upper Rhine Graben is one element from the rift system in the Alpine orogeny located in southwest Germany.
