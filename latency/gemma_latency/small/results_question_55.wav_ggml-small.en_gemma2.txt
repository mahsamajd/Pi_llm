Transcription:    Context. The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties,
   especially among large firms in the past. Architects, interior designers, engineers,
   developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely
   separate companies, even in the larger firms presently. A firm that is nominally an "architecture"
   or "construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees,
   or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may
   offer itself as one-stop shopping for a construction project. From beginning to end,
   this is designated as a "design build/contract" where the contractor is given a performance.
   Specification and must undertake the project from design to construction,
   while adhering to the performance specifications. Question. The modern trend in design is toward
   integration of what?

Answer:    The integration of the various disciplines in the design and construction of buildings
   is referred to as a "design build/contract." The design/construction firm is responsible for the
   design of the building, as well as the construction. The
