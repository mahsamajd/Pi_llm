Transcription:    Context, chemical barriers also protect against infection.
   The skin and respiratory tracts accrete antimicrobial peptides such as the beta defensions.
   Enzymes such as lysizym and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials.
   Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarky.
   When they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensions and zinc to kill pathogens.
   In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens, question.
   What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Response: Based on the following transcription, provide a detailed and specific answer. Make sure your response fully addresses the information given:

   What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?
Answer:

The stomach is lined with a mucus layer that secretes hydrochloric acid and enzymes that break down the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in food.
The mucous lining contains a large number of goblet cells that secrete mucus, which is a viscous fluid that
