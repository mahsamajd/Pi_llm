Transcription:    Context. The word "pharmacy" is derived from its root word "pharma" which was a term used
   since the 15th-17th centuries. However, the original Greek roots from pharmacos imply
   sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general
   medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist
   practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma, as it was referred to, often operated
   through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and
   patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages
   have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy.
   In English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only appropriate if herbal.
   Remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed.
   The Greek word pharmakeia (Greek, φαρμακία) derives from pharmakin, pharmakin, meaning
   "drug", "medicine", or "poison" (n1).
