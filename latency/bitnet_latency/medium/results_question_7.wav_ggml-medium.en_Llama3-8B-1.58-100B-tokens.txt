Transcription:    Context. The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William McClure.
   In 1807, McClure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the
   United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him.
   The Allegheny Mountains being crossed and re-crossed some 50 times. The results of
   his unaided labors were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir
   entitled "Observations on the Geology of the United States Explanatory of a Geological Map"
   and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the nation's first geological map.
   This antedates William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed
   using a different classification of rocks. Question. In what year did William McClure
   begin the process of creating the first geological map of the U.S.?
