   The first geological map of the US was produced in 1809 by William McClure.
   In 1807, McClure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States.
   Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him.
   The Allegheny Mountains being crossed and re-crossed some 50 times.
   The results of his unaided labors were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir
   entitled "Observations on the Geology of the United States' Explanatory of a Geological Map"
   and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the nation's first geological map.
   This anti-dates William Smith's geological map of England by six years,
   although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.
   Question
   In what year did William McClure begin the process of creating the first geological map of the US?
